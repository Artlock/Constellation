Issues :
//Issue 1 - I dont know what the project is about and how it works
//Issue 2 - Name generation fails now and then
//Issue 3 - Can place stars while display is happening
//Issue 4 - Can remove stars while display is happening and even if there is only 1 star in current constellation
//Issue 5 - Can fork stars while display is happening and repeatedly without placing any stars

Upgrades :
//Upgrade 1 - Add replay button when over that reloads the scene when game is over
//Upgrade 2 - Finish screenshot mode

Progress :
//Allow the player to open the screenshots folder from the main menu
//Allow the player to spin the final constellation using the mouse wheel
//- Parent all the constellation objects to an object placed at the center of the screen when they are initially created
//- Allow to rotate that parent object with the mouse wheel when creation is over
//- Zoom in/out camera on rotation
